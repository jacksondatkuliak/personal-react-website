        There is a significant amount of information I left out of the beginner
        articles to try and keep it (somewhat) reasonable for an average person
        to read and learn about astrophotography. If you have any questions or
        would like to learn more, you can reach out to me through my discord!
        Iâ€™d be happy to answer any questions. I would also like to list some
        great beginner resources to learn about astrophotography. This hobby is
        incredibly deep, and if you are truly interested in taking it on, having
        some good learning resources will be absolutely necessary. One of the
        biggest sources of learning for me was through watching YouTube videos.
        I will warn you, there are a lot of people on YouTube that have
        absolutely no idea what they are talking about. I will list some
        YouTubers that I believe have good, informative videos for beginners. I
        am NOT endorsing everything these guys say, but I can definitely say
        they have all had a big impact on my astrophotography journey.

        some of the discord servers listed below having data sharing channels,
        you can find free data to process at these links

        You will inevitably find yourself with lots of questions and no answers,
        so here are some discord servers where you can ask more experienced
        astrophotographers specific questions about anything
